        <p>Hi! My name is Ly Pham and I am a student majoring in Computer Science at Kennesaw State University</p>
        <p>Prior to college, I had no knowledge about computer science or programming at all.</p>
        <p>I became intrigued with how technology works and the human-computer interaction that
            I decided that programming would be something I enjoy doing.</p>
        <p>As a future engineer, I am prepared to take on challenges individually as well as collaboratively through my
            skill set that I have accumulated over the past
            semesters.</p>
        <p>I have an interest to create products that are
        high quality, efficient, and user-friendly.  </p>
